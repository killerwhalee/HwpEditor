# HwpEditor

HwpEditor
Developed by `CHAEMIN LIM` and `JUNHYEOK YOO`

## Introduction

HwpEditor is simple hml editor by using xml parsing module.
It also provides several API for people who want to use feature of HwpEditor for their developing.

## How to use HwpEditor?

Unfortunately, UI is not implemented yet, but we are planning to introduce TUI for HwpEditor since final goal of this is to fully edit hml file in linux environment.

Every text, equation, shape is grouped by same paragraph shape and character shape. Using this feature, you can edit "block" of text, equation, shape.

## About API

API of HwpEditor provides block information parsed from original hml file.
You can edit each block's property(including paragraph/character shape and equation script..etc.) by using API of HwpEditor.

API information will soon be provided using wiki docs.

## Our future goals

We want many developers to make their own automated document writer or grammar checking program by using our HwpEditor and its API.

To achieve this, we know that we have to pour more energy to this "Big Toy" project(This project was first started just for fun).
